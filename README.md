# Summer Microkinetic Modeling Internship

Workspace for converting the *terrace‑aqueous* methanol microkinetic model  
from **mkmcxx (C++)** to **Julia** and reproducing published results.

## Folder layout
- `code/`  Scripts, notebooks, and Julia source
- `data/`  Input files (e.g., mkmcxx `.inp`, thermodynamics tables)
- `papers/`  PDFs and supplementary information
- `notes/` Daily lab notebook, design sketches
- `results/` Simulation outputs, plots

Happy modeling!
