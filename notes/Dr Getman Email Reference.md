Hi Jackson!

 

Great! I’ll put you on the project for converting the mkm code. I think it would be pretty ambitious to accomplish this plus one of the other projects, so for now let’s just focus on this one.

 

It is fine with me if you’d like to start June 9; however, I will not be here that day. I will be in Atlanta for a conference June 8-11. I will likely ask one of my grad students to oversee your project directly, though, so it should be OK to start while I’m gone.

 

In the meantime, here are some resources to get you started:

- The microkinetic model that I want to convert to Julia is the one reported in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951724002756#appSB). 
  - This paper reports 4-6 different models; let’s do the “terrace aqueous” model only.
  - The student who worked on this paper used the [mkmcxx code](https://www.mkmcxx.nl/). I have several students in the group who have used that code. I will likely ask one of them to be the one to directly oversee your project.
  - A good first milestone is to replicate the results that Ricardo got using mkmcxx.
- The Julia code that we can follow is reported [here](https://github.com/srgathmann/ProgrammableOER). The associated paper is [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65af381d66c13817290d5404). The paper reports both a “static” model and a variety of dynamic models (ratchets). Let’s focus only on the static model.
- You can probably start to teach yourself Julia using online videos. For example, [here](https://julialang.org/learning/) is a variety of resources on the Julia website. You can also Google for “Julia tutorial”.
- [This paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00394?casa_token=1zF0X4e1MPUAAAAA%3A7V4nCMsMz918kHW9ayWxQldtQ-1iKhfkSuOfLt6m7cSLaB03Li0RT2Csx0_k7BQ8Rzpx3GyBUFmIScg) gives a pretty extensive discussion about what microkinetic modeling entails.
- Microkinetic modeling involves aspects from physical chemistry and kinetics that you may not have encountered in your studies. [My youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSV5Smmq7NIA_Zml1k0b7CALucgmVm1LR&si=PDKHmCZazyE_Jo9H), specifically videos 10, 11, 23, 24, and 54-66, maybe helpful. 

 

There is way more to learn. I find it’s better to let students ask questions than to inundate with information. My general rule is: If you run into a problem, spend 15-30 minutes trying to solve it. If you cannot solve it after 30 minutes, ask. 

 

Looking forward to working with you.

 

Dr. Rachel
